Description
-----------

In 2013 most companies know about and are trying to do agile - it’s well and truly become a mainstream software development practice and widely acknowledged to be a good thing. This raises a number of questions:

* Once you have high performing teams successfully using Agile practices what is the next step?
* Rather than "doing" Agile are you actually "being" agile?
* If your competitors are also using Agile practices then how can you maintain a competitive advantage?

Find out how data analytics, continuous delivery, lean and agile project management all have a part to play in answering these questions.
